description: How to add support for a new protocol to the Governance SDK.

# âž• Integrating Your Protocol

{% hint style="info" %}
The Governance SDK is intended to be an open-source project for the community to use and contribute to, but at this time the repo and npm module are private as we finalize some things with the tech and process.

Got some ideas on things you'd want to build or want the latest alpha on our road to open-sourcing the project? [Hit us up on Discord](https://discord.gg/UBqtEddhsC) and let's chat. ðŸ‘‹
{% endhint %}

Support for a protocol can be added by submitting a pull request for a new protocol integration in the [Governance SDK monorepo](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/governance-sdk).

Protocols that use common governance frameworks or services will require very little code to integrate, but if a protocol does require some special mapping logic or has unique downstream data sources, completely custom protocol integrations can be authored.

## Protocol Registration

Protocols "register" with the SDK by implementing a `ProtocolRegistrationFunction` in the `gov-protocols` package of the SDK monorepo.

Protocol integrations are imperative functions that define some basic data for a protocol and register multiple adapter implementations that implement specific interfaces for querying governance data or enabling governance interactions.

Every protocol registration function _could_ potentially register multiple protocols at the same time -- this may make sense in some situations, but generally each protocol integration will have its own file. For instance, the Uniswap integration can be found at:

* `./packages/gov-protocols/src/uniswap.ts`

You can see all integration files here:

* [https://github.com/boardroom-inc/governance-sdk/tree/main/packages/gov-protocols/src](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/governance-sdk/tree/main/packages/gov-protocols/src)

### Example - Index Coop

Index Coop uses Snapshot for signed off-chain signaling of proposals, and is listed on CoinGecko. We can use the [prebuilt adapters](../governance-frameworks/) to quickly integrate this protocol with the Governance SDK:

```typescript
import { ProtocolRegistrationFunction } from '@boardroom-labs/gov-lib';
import {
  CoinGeckoAdapter,
  SnapshotProposalsAdapter }
from '@boardroom-labs/gov-adapters';

export const register: ProtocolRegistrationFunction = (register, transports) => {
  register({
    cname: 'indexCoop',
    name: 'Index',
    adapters: (adapters) => {
      const snapshot = new SnapshotProposalsAdapter('index', transports);
      const coingecko = new CoinGeckoAdapter('index-cooperative', transports);
      adapters.implement('proposals', snapshot);
      adapters.implement('token', coingecko);
      adapters.implement('icons', coingecko);
    },
  });
};
```

* All registration functions should have a `ProtocolRegistrationFunction` type. This will correctly enforce return types and provide typings for the function parameters.
* The `register` function can be called multiple times to register multiple protocols in the same registration function, though unrelated protocols should still be implemented in separate modules.
* A protocol must, at minimum, specify the `cname` and `name` for that protocol. All other fields are optional
* Ensure that the `index.ts` file in `./packages/gov-protocols/src` is updated if a new integration file is added
