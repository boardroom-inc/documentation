# Boardroom Discord Bot

This is a bot that interacts with [Boardroom's API](../boardroom-api/boardroom-api.md) and subscribes to new events for all [supported protocols](../protocols.md). There are two sets of commands: Commands to get **general information** and commands for **subscriptions**.

_Subscriptions are run through every 30 seconds, but the checks are only done based on the `frequency` argument. By default, this is every 15 minutes._

{% hint style="info" %}
**Install the Bot by** [**following this link**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=887036149556719678&permissions=2147485696&scope=applications.commands%20bot) **and refer to the Commands outlined below** ðŸ‘‡
{% endhint %}

## Deploy Instructions \(Optional\)

\*\*\*\*[**See the Bot Repo here**](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/boardroom-discord-bot)\*\*\*\*

This bot uses AWS DynamoDB to store the subscriptions, so the `aws-cli` must be set up in the machine running it, with a table called `subscriptions` and a primary key called `id`. You can see a CDK example [here](https://github.com/Zerquix18/boardroom-bot-cdk/blob/master/lib/boardroom-stack-stack.ts#L28).

The name of the table can be changed from the Dynamo service on this project.

The `.env.example` can be used to create an `.env` file which the token which is created on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once there's an `.env` file, run the commands:

* `npm install`
* `npm run tsc`
* `node bot.js`
