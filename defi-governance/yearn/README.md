### **yEarn Governance Flow** <a id="4ce3"></a>

The governance forum is a place to discuss all proposals, amendments, and desired upgrades to the yEarn protocol. 

> **The official governance forum can be found at** [**https://gov.yearn.finance/**](https://gov.yearn.finance/)

This includes but is not limited to:

* Governance Frameworks
* Proposal Discussions
* Fee Allocations
* Value-Added Incentives
* Pool Additions & Amendments
* Protocol Economics

Proposals can be made by anyone, however, it should be noted that just because a proposal is submitted to the forum **does not** mean it will \(or should\) go to an onchain vote. Only those which are put to \(and pass\) an onchain vote will be ratified.

## **How to Vote** <a id="865e"></a>

All onchain proposals will live on [ygov.finance/vote](https://ygov.finance/vote). To participate in governance, you must have Meta Yield Governance shares. Now, we know this takes 10,000 IQ so bare with us.

Meta Yield Governance shares are earned by staking the Balancer Pool Tokens \(BPT\) representing [this 98/2 yCurve/YFI pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x95C4B6C7CfF608c0CA048df8b81a484aA377172B). Your stake in the pool will issue you yGov tokens which gives you the ability to vote on yEarn proposals.

### **Future Precedent** <a id="5e3a"></a>

yEarn governance is taken one day at a time. There is no set in stone roadmap to introduce new features. By participating in governance, you fully understand that the continued governance is entirely based upon community interest and participation.

New proposals will be added for onchain voting on a completely asynchronous basis. If there’s enough attention and people care, it will go to a vote. You can not use YFI to influence a proposal being pushed onchain and there is no formal framework \(to date\) for what dictates a proposal being eligible for an onchain vote.
