# Getting Started

### Contributor Program

The Boardroom contributor program allows community members to add relevant and pertinent information to a project's hub in the Boardroom Portal. We currently  support the following types of updates:

*  Changes to the **Project's Metadata**
  * Project Name
  * Description
  * Avatar and Header logo
  * etc...
* **Resources**
* **Calendar Events**

### Protocol Information Repository 

All these updates occur in the public [Boardroom 'Protocol Information' repository](https://github.com/boardroom-inc/protocol-Info) on Github. In order to update a project with an edit or an additional resource, simply log into Github and submit a pull request.

### What is Github? 

Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 

If you're new to Github, check out these useful guides: 

* [https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)
* [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Creating a Github Account

To contribute to the Boardroom protocol-info repository on Github, you'll need to first make an account: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) 

Once a project is added to Boardroom, teams can add and update the information displayed on their project's page in the governance portal.
