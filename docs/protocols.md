# Supported DAOs

Here are the projects that are currently supported by the Boardroom Platform. Each project has a list of implemented [Adapters](sdk/adapters/), which allow querying governance data or executing actions in a standard way. The implemented adapters determine the available functionality for a given project.

All projects listed here are currently integrated with both the [Governance SDK ](sdk/governance-sdk/)and the [Boardroom API](boardroom-api/boardroom-api/). If there is a link in the Protocol Info column, the project is also enabled in the [Boardroom Portal](broken-reference/). If not, there will be a link to instructions on [Adding Your Project](broken-reference/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Don't see your project on the list below?** Check out the [Add a DAO](adding-your-project/2.-submit-your-metadata.md) page.
