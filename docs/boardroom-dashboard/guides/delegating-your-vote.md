# üë• Delegating Your Vote

We realize that you may often be too busy or would rather use a proxy to cast a vote on your behalf - this can be easily set up on the Boardroom application. The important thing is that your vote counts!

{% hint style="info" %}
_Not all DAOs allow for votes to be delegated, but if they do; please read on._

**Navigating to a DAO project that supports delegation**

There are tons of ways for you to find the DAO where you want to delegate your vote. Boardroom lets you scroll through visual cards for each DAO or you can filter by DAO category as in the image below.

When you click on a DAO's card, let‚Äôs use Compound, for example, you will see the **About** section. On the right side of the page, below the **Vote Power and Status**, you can click on **Delegate**.
