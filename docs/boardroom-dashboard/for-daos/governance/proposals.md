# ðŸ“„ Proposals Page

Each Proposal page contains a description of the given proposal, generally containing a short summary of the proposed changes, goals and motivations for the proposed actions, and an implementation spec. 

This page highlights a list of the most recent proposals associated with a DAO. If a DAO has multiple governance frameworks, proposals are filterable by On-Chain and Off-Chain options.
