# Governance API

This API helps projects and developers keep their users informed and engaged across governance systems that anchor hundreds of communities. You can find most of the data used to power the [Boardroom Dashboard](https://boardroom.io/) here.

**See it here:** [**https://swagger.boardroom.info/**](https://swagger.boardroom.info/)

#### What will you find in those docs?

For 175+ DAOs, you can query governance data for:

* DAOs
* Proposals
* Voters
* Votes
* Delegates
* Delegations

> Be sure to request your API Keys at the bottom of this page

#### What is the Governance API?

Boardroom's Governance API allows you to quickly get all the information you need to know about DAOs and their governance from the blockchain (i.e. Ethereum, Optimism, etc). Rather than searching, indexing, and storing data yourself - you can now make one request to fetch specific governance information, like:

* All proposals voted on by an Ethereum address

**What can I make?**

Using the Boardroom Governance API allows you to both fetch and display governance data for your users, making it easy to build all kinds of DAO projects.
