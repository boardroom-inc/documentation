# Boardroom API

The **Boardroom API** is a centralized HTTP API that uses the open-source [Governance SDK](../../sdk/governance-sdk/) to continually index and aggregate governance data across all integrated protocols at scale.

The request and response payloads can be referenced via our interactive Swagger documentation

**See it here:** [**https://swagger.boardroom.info/**](https://swagger.boardroom.info/)****

_ðŸš€ The above link can be used to make actual requests against the Boardroom API and is an excellent way to start exploring our governance data!_

## **API Keys**

The API will soon require the use of keys, request one at the link below.
Once you have an api key add it as a 'key' query parameter to all of your requests to the boardroom api.

**For example:** https://api.boardroom.info/v1/protocols?limit=5&key=your-api-key
