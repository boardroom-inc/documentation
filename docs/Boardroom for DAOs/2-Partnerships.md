## Facilitators Program

### Delegate Boost
The Boardroom Facilitators program allows DAOs and Foundations to subsidize the cost of Boardroom Boost for a minumum of 50 delegates at a 15% discounted rate. The DAO project will receive one year, 100% discount codes to distribute to their top delegates. 

> Learn more about the benefits of **Boardroom Boost** for voters and delegates [**here**](../Boardroom-Boost/About-Boost.md).

### Coverage
In addition to the 

**Why sign up for Boardroom coverage?**

**Neutrality** - Neutrality is essential to be a credible steward of governance within Aave. Ultimately Boardroom has this mandate because it is trusted by governance participants across multiple protocols to create and manage governance tooling without bias toward outcomes.

**Consistent Support** - The governance processes of organizations like Aave struggle to operate consistently and clearly without continuous coordination. Boardroom Governance Facilitators fulfill the role of officials in traditional systems of governance, leaving those involved in governance able to spend more time on decision-making and discussion.

**Offload** **Delegate Responsibilities** - informed delegates spend 20+ hours a week engaging in governance forums, lobbying activities, and extensive off-forum work discussing with proposer teams, DAO members, and other delegates.

**Content and Communication** - Content creation and communications are key pieces of governance maintenance. It isn't easy to facilitate effective governance if high-quality communication platforms and norms do not exist. Governance Facilitators will provide consistent independent analyses and summaries of proposals, governance changes, and events tracking to ensure delegates and tokenholders are kept continually informed.
