## How does the program help your community?

The DAO project will receive one year, 100% discount codes to distribute to their top delegates. This program renews every year at which point new codes will be issued for all users. |

#### **Why is coverage valuable?**

- **Neutrality** - Neutrality is essential to be a credible steward of governance. Ultimately Boardroom has this mandate because it is trusted by governance participants across multiple protocols to create governance tooling without bias toward outcomes.
- **Consistent Support** - The governance processes of communities struggle to operate consistently and clearly without continuous coordination. Boardroom fulfills the role of officials in traditional systems of governance, leaving those involved in governance able to spend more time on decision-making and discussion.
- **Offload Delegate Responsibilities** - informed delegates spend 20+ hours a week engaging in governance forums, lobbying activities, and extensive off-forum work discussing with proposer teams, DAO members, and other delegates.
- **Content and Communication** - Content creation and communications are key pieces of governance maintenance. It isn't easy to facilitate effective governance if high-quality communication platforms and norms do not exist.
