The success and sustainability of your project relies on the participation and decision-making of your community. By providing your voters with access to a comprehensive and user-friendly governance dashboard, you can help to increase transparency and participation in the decision-making of your project.

> Boardroom currently supports over 250 projects and can support projects built on any governance system. [Learn more here.](../2-protocols.md)

Our [Governance API](https://docs.boardroom.io/docs/api) also makes this data free and accessible for any stakeholder or developer. This interface can ensure that your community is well-informed and actively engaged in the decision-making processes of your organization:

Providing your community with access to a comprehensive governance dashboard can  help build trust and credibility for your DAO. By demonstrating that you value the input and contributions of your members, you can encourage greater adoption and success for your project. Investing in a governance dashboard is an important step towards building a strong and engaged community that is essential to the long-term success of your DAO.

Check if your project is [already listed](../2-protocols.md), or submit a [request for listing](../adding-your-project/2.-submit-your-metadata.md).
