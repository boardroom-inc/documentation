# Adding Resources

The information served in the Boardroom SDK and API and displayed in the Governance Portal is updated by core and community contributors. 

In addition to a project's metadata, contributors are encouraged to add and maintain the following: 

* **Content Folders** - Add content to the Resources tab 
* **Files** - Store relevant documents or media for easy sharing
* **Calendar Events** - Populate the Calendar tab with events, governance calls, upcoming votes, and more. 
* **Weekly Updates** - Summarize what members need to know about governance each week. These updates are housed in the Resources tab in the portal and included in Boardroom's weekly newsletter on [Stateless](https://governance.substack.com/), our Substack. 

To add content for a project, follow these steps:
