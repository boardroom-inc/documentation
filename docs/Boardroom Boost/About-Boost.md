# Boost Your Experience

[Boardroom Boost](https://boardroom.io/feed/settings/feed) is an enhanced experience of the governance dashboard built for highly engaged voters and delegates. A boosted account allows a connected wallet to completely customize their governance experience by allowing a user to track specific projects accross the application as well as post updates to their delegators.
