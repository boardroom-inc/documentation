# Boardroom API

The **Boardroom API** is a centralized HTTP API that uses the open-source [Governance SDK](../sdk/governance-sdk.md) to continually index and aggregate governance data across all integrated protocols at scale. 

We believe that free and open access to aggregated governance data is a crucial tool in navigating the rapidly growing ecosystem of stakeholder owned crypto networks, so we've made the same API we use to power the [Boardroom Portal](../boardroom-portal-1/getting-started.md) publically available.

If you are looking to integrate governance data into your application, get in touch with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UBqtEddhsC), we'd love to hear your ideas and talk about what we have in store ðŸš€

## Integrate Your Protocol

The Boardroom API is powered by our open-source Governance SDK, so if you'd like to see your protocol included in the API's data, you'll need to implement a protocol integration with the SDK first.
